# General Structure Rules 
1. When PIECE and SQUARE are together, the order is PIECE SQUARE
2. There must be a VERB in the command
3. VERBs either come at the start or after the first PIECE/SQUARE
4. VERBs must always have a target (not necessarily a source)
5. When promotion is given with another command, it comes at the end of the sentence.
6. Promotion always needs a PRM_PIE
7. The verb 'Move' is always followed by the source_piece/source_square
8. The verb 'Capture' is always followed by the target_piece/target_square
