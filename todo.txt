Gestures:
    1. Moving cursor with hand (both translation and rotation).
        a. Find position of hand in 3d space (weighted average between certain landmarks of hand).
        b. Find normal of hand (cross product between certain vectors of hand's landmarks).
        c. Find closest point on screen from hand (intersection between screen and line perpendicular to the screen passing through hand).
        d. Find intersection between screen and hand's normal.
        e. Interpolate between the two points (closest one and intersection) and decide how to move cursor.
    2. Recognize gestures:
        a. Grabbing and dropping
        b. Selecting

Speech Interaction:
    1. Define the possible sentences.
        "Pezzo1 a rango1 e fila1 muovi/cattura pezzo2 a rango2 e fila2, promuovi a pezzo3" = (src_piece, src_rank, src_file, command, tgt_piece, tgt_rank, tgt_file, prm_piece)
        "promuovi a pezzo3" = (None, None, None, None, None, None, None, prm_piece)
        "King-side/Queen-side castle" = (pezzo1, None, None, move, None, rango2, fila2, None)
        "cattura pezzo2" = (None, None, None, tipo_di_comando, pezzo2, None, None, None)
        "cattura in rango e fila" = (None, None, None, tipo_di_comando, None, rango2, fila2, None)
        a. Translate sentences into "universal commands".
    2. Fill missing info from universal commands through game context.
        a. Recover missing info, error if given information is not enough to process a unique command.
        b. Check whether it is a legal move.
    3. Execute command.
